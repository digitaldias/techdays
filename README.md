Demo of ASP.Net 5/vNext

In this demo, you'll see how the ASP.Net 5 (vNext) code can be compiled and ran on any OS (windows, or Mac & Linux using Mono). 
It showcases parts of my plant watering project where I use a .Net Gadgeteer mainboard to retrieve and send sensor readings to the ASP.NET
site that acts as a gateway to Azure, where all the readings are stored. 

The example follows the Domain Driven Design architecture, and builds largely on SOLID principles, using Single Reponsability Principle, 
and Dependency Inversion Principles extensively.
